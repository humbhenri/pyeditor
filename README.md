# PyEditor

## Overview

PyEditor is a simple and lightweight text editor built with Python's Tkinter framework. It allows users to open, edit, save, and manage text files efficiently from a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Features

- **File Management**: Open, edit, and save text files.
- **MD5 Checksum**: Calculate MD5 checksums for file contents to ensure data integrity.
- **Graphical Interface**: An easy-to-use GUI built with Tkinter.
- **Scroll Support**: Integrated scrollbar for easy navigation within text files.

## Installation Instructions

To install and set up PyEditor, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyeditor.git
    cd pyeditor
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python and Tkinter installed. If not, you can install Tkinter using:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python-tk
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python mainwindow.py
    ```

## Usage Examples

To use PyEditor, simply follow these steps:

1. **Launch the editor**:
    ```bash
    python mainwindow.py
    ```

2. **Open a file**: Use the file menu to open an existing file.
    ```python
    from tkFileDialog import askopenfilename

    filename = askopenfilename()
    if filename:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
        print(content)
    ```

3. **Edit the content**: Modify the text as needed in the text area.

4. **Save the file**: Use the save option in the file menu to save your changes.

## Code Summary

The project structure consists of the following key files:

- **buffer.py**: Manages the content within the editor using a Tkinter `Text` widget. It initializes the text area and sets up the scrollbar.
    ```python
    class Buffer(tk.Text):
        def __init__(self, master, filename=None, modified_callback=None):
            self.filename = filename
            tk.Text.__init__(self, master, height=20, width=72)
            # Additional configuration and setup
    ```

- **mainwindow.py**: Defines the main window of the editor, manages buffers, handles file dialogs, and integrates other components.
    ```python
    class MainWindow(Frame):
        def __init__(self, master=None):
            self.master.title('pyeditor')
            self.master.geometry('640x480')
            self.buffers = []
            self.create_widgets()
            # Additional initialization
    ```

- **text.py**: Houses text manipulation tools, including the MD5 checksum function.
    ```python
    def md5sum(contents):
        return md5.md5(contents).digest()
    ```
